-- 021 — Entries created automatically, flagged until someone completes them.
--
-- Typing a new artist (or institution) into an artwork's form creates a minimal entry instead of refusing the save;
-- the Wikidata comparison also creates entries on request. Such entries have little more than a name, so they are
-- listed here until they are first edited and published (or deleted). The quality view shows them as a warning,
-- the entry's page as a banner.
