-- 052 — Translations of titles and names: official, common or own.
-- In art history it matters whose a translated title is: the holding institution's (official — cited as such), one in
-- use in the literature or on Wikidata (common), or the author's own (marked, by convention in [square brackets]).
--   · other names (names jsonb): a translation may carry "status": official | own (common = the default, not stored)
--   · the main title of an artwork can itself be a translation — Japanese prints have their English title as the title
--     (the owner's convention) — so artworks get title_status (NULL: the original title, or not said)
-- An official translation wants a source: both are citable fields (049); the quality check weakly_sourced asks for one
-- only where something claims to be official.
